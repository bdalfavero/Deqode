# Deqode

Course materials for decoding quantum error-correcting codes

Course goals:
- Understand basic decoders for classical and quantum error-correcting codes.
- Implement a minimum weight perfect matching (MWPM) decoder.
- Implement a stabilizer simulator in the style of CHP.
- Simulate a memory experiment with some combination of code, noise model, and decoder, e.g. Surface code with depolarizing noise and a WMPM decdoer.
